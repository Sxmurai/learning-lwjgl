# learning-lwjgl
My code for learning the Java library LWJGL (ofc for java 16)

I'm going to be honest, I have 0 clue how OpenGL works or how the fuck shit works, and it's a useful skill to have especially with making "block game utility mods" or just making little projects that need 3D rendering that would work on all systems (windows, linux, mac. y'know).
